## ATM_Interface-Task-2
ATM Machine
Welcome to the ATM Interface repository! This Java-based project is designed this repository has you covered.

ATM (Automated Teller Machine)
interface project in Java is to create a simulation of an
ATM system that allows users to perform various
banking transactions, such as withdrawing cash,
checking account balance, depositing money, and
transferring funds between accounts. The project aims
to provide a user-friendly and secure interface to
interact with the ATM functionalities.

## Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language for building the ATM functionality.

Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have JDK (Java Development Kit)
installed on your system to write and compile Java code.

## ATM Interface

User Interface: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the user.
The GUI should display options for different transactions and receive input from the
user.
Account Management: Design a system to manage user accounts, including storing
account information, such as account number, PIN (Personal Identification Number),
and account balance.
Transaction Processing: Implement the logic to process various ATM transactions,
such as cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, deposits, and fund transfers.
